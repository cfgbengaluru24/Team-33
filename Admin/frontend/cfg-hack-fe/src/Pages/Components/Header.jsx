        <h2>EXPA (NCC Exchange Participants Association of India)</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, EXPAs have been working on various social causes to support the community. 
          In 2015-16, EXPAs came together to start an organized effort to give back to community that
          they gained so much from â€“ the NCC. This led to the discussion with the then DDG of Karnataka 
          and Goa which led to the birth of the CADET Program. Hear more from some of our Trainers 
          who have been a part of this journey!
